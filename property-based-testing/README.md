# Don’t Write Tests: Write Properties! – Property-based Testing in Scala

Sourcecode zum JavaMagazin-Artikel.

## Usage

This is a sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt
run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

However, as the article is concerned with testing, you are probably more
interested in running the test suite with `sbt test`, or go start a sbt test
console with `sbt "Test / console"`.
